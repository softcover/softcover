# Document README (please edit)

This is the README generated by `softcover new <document>`. It's not used by the [Softcover](https://www.softcover.io/) website, but it's a good practice to have a README when storing your document's source at, e.g., [GitHub](https://github.com/).

Softcover documents come with a `.gitignore` file for use with [Git](https://git-scm.com/). To get started, add your files as follows:

    $ git add -A
    $ git commit -m "Initialize repository"

Then follow the instructions at [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) to create and push a remote repository.
