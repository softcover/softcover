# A chapter

This is the first paragraph of the PolyTeXnic Markdown template. It shows how to write a document in Markdown, a lightweight markup language, augmented with the [kramdown](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/) converter and some custom extensions. (The other available input format is *PolyTeX*, a subset of the *LaTeX* typesetting language optimized for ebooks. PolyTeX has a more complicated syntax but is more powerful.) For more information, see *The PolyTeXnic Book*, available online at <http://polytexnic.org/book>. To learn how to easily publish (and optionally sell) documents produced with PolyTeXnic, visit [Softcover.io](http://softcover.io/).

This is the *secon* paragraph, showing how to emphasize text.[^sample_footnote] You can also make text **bold** or _emphasize a second way_.

*Note*: "PolyTeXnic" is pronounced exactly like the English word *polytechnic*, and "\LaTeX" is pronounced *lay*-tech (with "tech" as in "technology").[^pronunciation]

## A section

This is a section.

### Source code

This is a subsection.

You can typeset code samples and other verbatim text using four space of indentation:

    def hello
      puts "hello, world"
    end

PolyTeXnic also comes with full support for syntax-highlighted source code using kramdown's default syntax, which combines the language name with indentation:

{lang="ruby"}
    def hello
      puts "hello, world"
    end

PolyTeXnic's Markdown mode also extends kramdown to support "code fencing" from GitHub-flavored Markdown:

```ruby
def hello
  puts "hello, world!"
end
```

### Mathematics

PolyTeXnic's Markdown mode supports limited mathematical typesetting, including inline math, such as {$$}\phi^2 - \phi - 1 = 0{/$$}, and centered math, such as

{$$}
\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.
{/$$}


## Images and tables

This is the second section.

PolyTeXnic supports the inclusion of images, like this:

### Tables

PolyTeXnic supports raw tables via a simple table syntax:

|**HTTP request** | **URL** | **Action** | **Purpose** |
| `GET` | /users | `index` | page to list all users |
| `GET` | /users/1 | `show` | page to show user with id `1` |
| `GET` | /users/new | `new` | page to make a new user |
| `POST` | /users | `create` | create a new user |
| `GET` | /users/1/edit | `edit` | page to edit user with id `1` |
| `PATCH` | /users/1 | `update` | update user with id `1` |
| `DELETE` | /users/1 | `destroy` | delete user with id `1` |


## Command-line interface

PolyTeXnic comes with a command-line interface called `poly`. To get more information, just run `poly help`:

```console
$ poly help
Commands:
  poly build, build:all           # Build all formats
  poly build:epub                 # Build EPUB
  poly build:html                 # Build HTML
  poly build:mobi                 # Build MOBI
  poly build:pdf                  # Build PDF
  poly build:preview              # Build book preview in all formats
  poly config                     # View local config
  poly config:add key=value       # Add to your local config vars
  poly epub:validate, epub:check  # Validate EPUB with epubcheck
  poly help [COMMAND]             # Describe available commands...
  poly login                      # Log into Softcover account
  poly logout                     # Log out of Softcover account
  poly new <name>                 # Generate new book directory structure.
  poly open                       # Open book on Softcover website (OS X only)
  poly publish                    # Publish your book on Softcover
  poly publish:screencasts        # Publish screencasts
  poly server                     # Run local server
```

For additional help on a given command, run `poly help <command>`:

```console
$ poly help build
Usage:
  poly build, build:all

Options:
  -q, [--quiet]   # Quiet output
  -s, [--silent]  # Silent output

Build all formats
```

## Miscellanea

This is the end of the template---apart from two mostly empty chapters. In fact, letâ€™s include the last chapter in its entirety, just to see how mostly empty it is:

<<(markdown/yet_another_chapter.md, lang: text)

[^sample_footnote]: This is a footnote. It is numbered automatically.

[^pronunciation]: Pronunciations of "LaTeX" differ, but *lay*-tech is the one I prefer.
